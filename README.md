OLAN (formerly Bank Of Josh) offers a banking and trading platform.
OLAN is mobile-responsive and has 8 models. It differs from all projects done with the introduction of banking, finance and stocks trading, hence providing a more complex but exciting and easy to use software.

FUNCTIONALITIES
- The user can 'Register' with OLAN.
- After registration, the user can open different types of accounts; Savings, Current and Help-To-Buy accounts, when the user clicks on the 'Add account' tab.
- On opening the account(s), account numbers and sort codes are randomly generated and all users are given default balances of Â£5,000.00 for each account opened. All users cannot open more than 1 account per account type.
- The user can transfer the "funds" between the different accounts owned by the user and transfer to external accounts (belonging to another user). That can be done with the 'Send money' tab.
- The user can view the current balances of all accounts owned with 'My Accounts' tab.
- The user can view the transaction history for all the accounts opened when the user clicks the desired account.
- The user can deposit "money" from any account opened into the trading account with a base currency of USD and can also withdraw to any desired account; thanks to a currency converter API. This can be done with the 'Deposit' and 'Withdraw' buttons.
- The user can monitor the current prices of stocks using Watchlist functionality included in the app at the bottom of the page.
- The user can remove stocks currently in the Watchlist by clicking the 'Remove' button.
- The user can buy with no limit to the number of shares as long as the user can afford it by clicking on the 'Place Trade' button.
- The user can view the active trades and sell stocks previously bought by clicking on the 'Active Trades' button then 'Sell' button.
