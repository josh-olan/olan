Bank of Josh is a web application in which users/customers can create accounts, send money and receive money from family, friends and loved ones.

The first page the user sees is the 'Login' page. The user then has to create an account with the "Bank" by clicking the "Register" button at the top right corner of the page.
The user then has to enter his/her first, last and usernames and also enter desired password in the two password fields. Checks are in place if the passwords do not match, if the username already exists or if any field is blank.
After clicking the 'Register' button, the user is directed to an 'Enter pin' page where the user has to enter a four digit pin in two fields.
The user cannot go past that page if the pins do not match or if no value is input. The user cannot input more than 4 values in the input fields and the button is disabled until when 4 integers are input in the fields.

The user is then prompted to select an account to create. When the 'Create Account' button is clicked, an account number is automatically generated and the user is taken to an account summery page of all the accounts owned by the user.

The user can add more account types by clicking the 'Create new account' button and following the same steps.
The user can send money by clicking the 'Send money' button at the top right hand of the page.
The user then has to enter the recipient's first name, last name, account number, account from which the user intends to send money from and the description of the transaction.
Checks are in place if the names do not match the name on the account, if the account number exists and if the user has sufficient funds for the transaction. All fields must be filled before the user can make the transaction.

When the transaction is made, the user is redirected to the accounts summary page where the updated balance is displayed.
The user can navigate to the 'Transactions history' page by clicking on the 'Transactions' button at the top right.
Details of all transactions are displayed there; the account, transaction, description, balance and the timestamp.

The user can logout of the account by clicking on the 'Logout' button. The session is cleared and the 'Login' page is displayed.

The user can then decide to log back in by entering the username, password in the two password fields. Of course checks are present if passwords do not match or that is not the password for the user or if any of the fields is blank.
Once teh user enters the currect username and the correct password, the user is directed to an 'Enter pin' page where the user has to enter the pin previously created.

If the user enters the correct pin, the accounts summary page is then displayed.

Yes, the pins and passwords are hashed!

Thank you!
